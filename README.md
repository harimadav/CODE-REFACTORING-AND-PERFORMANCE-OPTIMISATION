## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this task was to *refactor and improve* an existing open-source weather application for better aesthetics, usability, and design responsiveness.

The modifications were focused purely on:
- index.html
- style.css

This ensures that the core functionality and API integration remain untouched while the user experience and UI quality are significantly enhanced.



## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Frontend | APIs | UI Libraries |
|----------|------|--------------|
| HTML5    | OpenWeatherMap API | Boxicons |
| CSS3     | –    | Google Fonts |



## 🎯 Key Modifications & Enhancements



### ✅ 1. Layout & Responsiveness
- Restored original centered alignment of the weather box.
- Ensured the weather box remains centered even after footer addition.
- Fixed CSS alignment issues from earlier broken layouts.
  

### ✅ 2. *Footer Implementation*
- Added a minimal, centered footer at the *bottom of the page*.
- Footer appears *only after scrolling* (not fixed), for clean UX.
  

### ✅ 3. *Social Media Icons with Links*
- *LinkedIn*: Added with official blue color theme.
- *GitHub*: Added with black theme.
- *Instagram*: Added with gradient color referring to official branding.
- All icons are *clickable* and open in new tabs.
  

### ✅ 4. *Polishing UI Consistency*
- Ensured iconography (Boxicons) is consistent.
- Fonts and padding across sections adjusted via style.css.
